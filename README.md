# Void Finder ðŸ”Ž

Void Finder is an OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) tool designed to investigate and uncover the potential origin IP address of a website, especially when it's hidden behind a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or a web proxy.

## Features

This tool uses a variety of techniques to gather information and identify potential origin servers:

* **DNS Analysis**: Checks basic `A` records and looks for IPs associated with `MX` (mail) records.
* **Subdomain Scanning**: Scans a list of common subdomains (`dev`, `cpanel`, etc.) that might point directly to the origin server.
* **HTTP Header Inspection**: Analyzes response headers for clues about server software or leaked IPs.
* **Shodan Search (Optional)**: Queries the Shodan database for historical data associated with the domain.
* **WHOIS Enrichment**: Performs a WHOIS lookup on all found IP addresses to identify their owners, helping distinguish between CDNs and hosting providers.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CypherNova1337/Void_Finder
    cd Void_Finder
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration (Optional)

Void Finder works right out of the box. However, you can enhance its capabilities by adding a Shodan API key.

* Open `void_finder.py` with a text editor.
* Find the `SHODAN_API_KEY` variable and replace the placeholder text with your key.
* **Note**: Effective use of the Shodan search filter generally requires a paid API key. If no key is provided, the script will automatically and safely skip this step.

## Usage

Run the tool from your command line, passing the target domain as an argument.

```bash
python void_finder.py <domain_to_investigate>
```

### Example

```bash
python void_finder.py example.com
```

The script will perform its investigation and print a final report summarizing its findings, separating likely CDN IPs from potential origin server candidates.

This tool is intended for educational and professional security assessment purposes only. Always ensure you have permission before scanning any target.
